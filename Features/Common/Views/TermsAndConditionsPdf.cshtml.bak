                additional terms and conditions contained within the Purchase Order, and such additional terms are hereby expressly rejected. If there is a conflict between the Terms of Use
                and other agreements, including this Agreement, then those other agreements and this Agreement shall prevail.<br />

                option, shall (i) repair or replace the Non-Conforming Product or (ii) issue a credit equal to the actual purchase price of the Non-Conforming Product paid by the Company.

                specifications contained in the Purchase Order. Except as set forth in the prior sentence, the Distributor makes no other warranty, express or implied and all other warranties
                    are expressly disclaimed by Distributor.<br />

                indemnities are specifically disclaimed by the Distributor. The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the Distributor and its customers, officers, directors, agents and

                suffered on the grounds that the item, which is of the Company’s design or specification: (i) infringes on any copyright or patent; misappropriates a trade secret; or
                    otherwise violates an intellectual property right of a third party, or (ii) causes any bodily injury to or death of any person or damage to any property.<br />
                                                9. <u>

                jurisdiction other than the State of Texas. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Party hereto (i) agrees that any claim, action or proceeding by such
                    party seeking any relief whatsoever arising out of, relating to or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the
